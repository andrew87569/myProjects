# This weekâ€™s exercise is going to be revisiting an old exercise (see Exercise 5), except require the solution in a different way.

# Take two lists, say for example these two:

# 	a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# 	b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
# 
# and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). 
# Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes. Write this in one line of Python using at least one list comprehension. 
# (Hint: Remember list comprehensions from Exercise 7).

# Extra:

# - Randomly generate two lists to test this

import random

a = [random.randrange(1,50) for i in range(random.randrange(10,50))]
b = [random.randrange(1,50) for i in range(random.randrange(10,50))]
c = []
c = [i for i in set(a) if i in b and i not in c]

print(a,'\n',b,'\nCommon Numbers: ',c)
